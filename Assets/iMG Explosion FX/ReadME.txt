Thank you for purchasing iMG Explosion FX 

With this purchase you acquired carefully crafted high quality explosion fx assets.
iMG Explosion FX is created to work in the broadest possible range of environments. From low spec mobile devices to AAA cutting edge productions. 
The intention is to boost your project's special FX fidelity and save you and your team dozens of hours of rendering, compositing and particle system setup.

All texture sheets are rendered specifically for iMG Explosion FX, using only smoke and fire simulation solutions. No stock footage used!

This package includes:

Nine 4x4 frames animation texture sheets including explosion and smoke.
Each sheet comes with an alpha channel, so using premultiplied shader blending is possible and encouraged.

16 Prefabs containing pre-made particle Fxs for out of the box usage.
These prefabs showcase the versatility of the texture-sheets.

A selection of 40+ high resolution source images with transparent background to create your own effect textures from.
